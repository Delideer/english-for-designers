- A photomontage of a photo I randomly took while practicing photography. The original photo seemed too plain to me, so I decided to give it a little makeover.
- The whole working process of this was crucial to me because I learned a lot in terms of photo editing. 
- This little project made me realize that with a bit of imagination, you can turn a plain photo into a decent piece of art.




### Prague Music Festival Poster

- A concept poster for the United Islands of Prague Festival.

- The path of making these was a bit tricky in the beginning due to the rather abstract topic – music outside. I had to think outside the box.

- Fairly challenging project, but the newly learned skills and the final result felt rewarding.




### 2023 New Year’s Cards

- A concept for New Year's cards as a school assignment.
- I had fun while making these because we weren’t limited to anything in terms of the design. 
- I love the result of this because I got to create an unconventional, unique postcard without limiting myself to just make a plain New Year's card design. 




### Existentialist Book Cover

- This is a book cover I did for a typography class assignment. 
- Creating this helped me to think more freely while designing because there were no limitations with the book topic or design. 
- It took me a while to come up with this, but I eventually managed to design it exactly the way I wanted to.
