# Naive


## EDITED

Naive. This word used to have a negative meaning in my vocabulary, it made me feel insecure.

It’s no secret that when we’re young, we’re bound to be naive. You don’t know any better, after all. I mean, you have to start somewhere. You have to experience things, both good and bad. But that’s what shapes you into the kind of people you later become.

A few years ago, I had a crush on my classmate. Despite only knowing each other for a few weeks at the time, I felt like he understood me as a person. I never told him how I felt, but he noticed it pretty early on. 
“So you have a crush on me, huh? You’re so naive.“, he said as if he was mocking me. I got embarrassed but it was a bit of a relief, too. He said it to my face with the most careless expression that I remember to this day. I'd be lying if I said he didn't hurt my feelings. It made me think that what I felt for him was insignificant. Hence I as a person was insignificant. 

But this dark mindset soon faded away. I started meeting new people. I found new hobbies. I began learning new things about me as a person. This new attitude on life turned out to be a huge inspiration for my past self. But it also remains a motivation for the person I strive to be in the future.

I’ve learned that oftentimes, being an “open book“ isn’t always a bad thing. In time, life's too short for you to play games or keep it cool with someone you care about. Sometimes, the best thing to do is to shoot your shot. Being yourself and showing vulnerability can become your powerful move. Even when you're risking the embarrassment or a heartbreak. Sure, sometimes it’s better to hide your feelings to protect your ego. But if you're infatuated with someone, telling them in the eye will help you to move on. One way or another. If you don’t tell them now, you might regret it later.

Being naive used to represent something bad, pitiful, not very cool in my eyes. It used to be this “icky“ trait of mine I had wanted to get rid of. Just because of a silly remark from a guy who I was putting on a pedestal... as it goes with crushes.

 Thanks to my new point of view, I changed the negative perception of myself. It was an illusion, an obstacle preventing me from becoming who I am today. So what if someone thinks I’m naive? Let me stay that way. It might be true that too much naivety isn't good for you. But that doesn’t mean you should be always rational and never make any mistakes. You'll lose a sense of hope and excitement. Without naivety, one becomes heartless. And without heart, one can’t love. If you can't love, life is pointless.
