**Hi there! I'm Adela.** A graphic designer with attitude, style, and punk rock ethos.

I like to do things my way, unapologetically. Whenever I get to design something on my own, only then can I truly express myself without the constraints of awful ideas or rules. Artists are often misunderstood. We have a different perspective on things. On life.

And that‘s when it‘s my turn, an aspiring graphic designer, to prove them wrong and design something amazing.

**I‘ve always been the quiet kid**,
ever since kindergarden. A very observant, though.
Since that time, I started noticing just how badly
people wanna fit in.
As much as I wanted to change and become another extroverted kid (peer pressure), I just couldn‘t. 
My introversion would always find its way back.  
A few years later - boom! Second year in college was
the milestone of it all. An insecure duckling has finally become a confident swan who doesn‘t give an F about other people‘s opinions. 
Not sure how exactly it happened, but I made it.
No more pleasing the others, just doing what makes me happy. Keeping my own style, no pressure to fit in. Whether it‘s just being an introvert or making art that‘s different from the rest. 
If you‘re quietly struggling like I once did, let me give you a simple advice: 
Don‘t be like everyone else. Be you.
