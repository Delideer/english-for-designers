## Adéla Koukalová



**Hi there! I'm Adela.** A graphic designer with attitude, style, and punk rock ethos.

I like to do things my way, unapologetically. Whenever I get to design something on my own, only then can I truly express myself without the constraints of awful ideas or rules. Artists are often misunderstood. We have a different perspective on things. On life.

And that‘s when it‘s my turn, an aspiring graphic designer, to prove them wrong and design something amazing.
