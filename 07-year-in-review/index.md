# Year in review

## Thesis

This year was one emotional rollecoaster for me. Writing the thesis was very stressful. 

Sure, it was another important step for the "better future." 
But those six months were exhausting regardless. 
School, coffee, school. 

It was the same all over again! Damn. I used to like going to college. I didn't know what actual stress was two years ago. 

I felt like I was spinning in a wheel without a single break.

I was often on the verge of losing my motivation to keep going.*I have to get it done!* I kept reminding myself.

There was this constant inner battle within me. 
On one hand, I wanted to relax and have fun in-between writing the thesis. 

The other me was afraid of becoming a failure if I got too relaxed. 

This was the cost of feeling anxious for this whole time because of the uncertainty that comes with it. 

The fear of failure was what motivated me to finish writing the thesis. I knew I'm doing this for myself, for my future.


## English class

After attending a year of english classes, I learned something. Other people generally don't give a crap about you.

Unless you're good friends or they have a crush on you. 

Until now, I would often get nervous while presenting a project in front of my classmates. But it changed this year. 

Guess I got to a point in life, where I gave up on caring about this nonsense.

It's *not* my business what they think. I'm here to showcase my work and cool personality. 

The only thing you should care about while talking in front of a large audience is to focus on your speech and have fun! 

The people who *do* appreciate you will come to the surface.


## Dealing with people

Stop wasting your time and kindness with someone who doesn't care. We tend to wear these pink sunglasses sometimes. 

It can take a while before we admit to ourselves that we're not *that* important in their lives.

If you keep being generous and kind to a person who doesn't deserve it from you, that's bad. 

But it's not that difficult to realize this once you think about the usual dynamic between you and them. 

Some people will try to use you to their advantage once you show them they can.

Soon, you'll only end up feeling mistreated and dissapointed. Spend time with people who care about you. 

Support your dreams and maintain good friendships/relationships with them.

## The takeaway:

Now, there's one crucial thing I learned this year.


Never give up on your dreams. Invest your time into things that matter to you. The things that elevates you to a higher level.

Stop limiting yourself based on other people's judgement about you.

Staying in your comfort zone might be the easiest thing, but it won't get you anywhere. You'll stay in the same rotting place with same people you might not even care about. 

There might be a lot of obstacles on the way. But at the end, the effort you put into it is worth it! You might not realize it during the process.

You might brag about how it's all meaningless and hard to do.

But once you achieve it, you'll find out that you're much more than you think. 

So please, don't waste your potential and don't give up on yourself. The right things will come to your way.
