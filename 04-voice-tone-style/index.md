# Voice, Tone, and Style (a draft for now...?)

*Hi there, folks! I'm Adela. An ambitious graphic designer with attitude, style, and punk rock ethos ;)*


## Voice

If I were to describe myself, it'd probably be honest, confident and down-to-earth.

Also, I don't like being late anywhere. I'm NEVER late, haha :D
While working on a project, I try my best to succeed.
And if it fails, then I try again! Because if you give up without trying, your confidence'll go downhill. You don't want that, am I right or am I right? ;)




1. **Honest** - *I'm not a big fan of small talks. Let's get down to business!* 
2. **Confident** - *Over the years, I've figured that being a timid little mouse won't get you nowhere. So get out there and show everyone what type of resilient metal you're made of!* 
3. **Down-to-earth** - *Hands down, one of the best qualities to have. No pretending, just being genuine and reasonable!*




## Tone

Although I've become more relaxed over the years, there're times where I focus on the way I sound to others. I think it matters a lot whether you're mindful of the way you talk versus when you're spitting nonsense.



1. **Friendly** - *The last thing I want is to make my people feel like I hate their guts. Just smile and you'll notice how easily your voice adjusts to those shiny teeth of yours!*
2. **Encouraging** - *Life is tough sometimes. We all tend to have days where the vibe's just off. Remember to support your people when they feel down. You might help them to feel better!*
3. **Witty** - *I believe that making your people laugh plays a huge part in gaining their trust. It might sound silly, but cracking a good joke here and there eases the atmosphere which helps you think more freely and efectively. Also, people will remember you easily!*



## Style

I tend to complicate things that aren't complicated at all :D Thankfully, I keep my communication style as simple as I can.



1. **Including my humor** - *I love my type of humor. Don't care if some people don't like it. I like making people laugh. It gives me more confidence and I genuinely feel happy when someone acknowledges my personality through my jokes!*
2. **Active voice** - *I am everything but a passive person. As an artist, I'm emotional and perceptive. I often struggle with just letting things be. I mean, you should fight for what you want, right? I want people to listen to what I have to say. I want them to know my energy and enthusiasm through my voice!*
4. **Specific** - *To avoid any misunderstandings, I tell people specifically my point!*
