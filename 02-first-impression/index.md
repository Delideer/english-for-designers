## About

**Adéla Koukalová**



Hi there! I'm Adela. A graphic design student with signature art style. I like to do things my way, unapologetically.

Whenever I get to design something on my own, only then can I truly express myself without the constraints of awful ideas or rules. Artists are often misunderstood. We have a different perspective on things. On life.

And that‘s when it‘s my turn, an aspiring graphic designer, to prove them wrong and design something amazing.

## Featured Projects

A few of my projects I did recently.





### Night Club Photomontage

- A photomontage of a photo I randomly took while practicing photography. The original photo seemed too plain to me, so I decided to give it a little makeover.
- The whole working process of this was crucial to me because I learned a lot in terms of photo editing. 
- This little project made me realize that with a bit of imagination, you can turn a plain photo into a decent piece of art.




### Prague Music Festival Poster

- A concept poster for the United Islands of Prague Festival.

- The path of making these was a bit tricky in the beginning due to the rather abstract topic – music outside. I had to think outside the box.

- Fairly challenging project, but the newly learned skills and the final result felt rewarding.




### 2023 New Year’s Cards

- A concept for New Year's cards as a school assignment.
- I had fun while making these because we weren’t limited to anything in terms of the design. 
- I love the result of this because I got to create an unconventional, unique postcard without limiting myself to just make a plain New Year's card design. 




### Existentialist Book Cover


![Black and white photo of Sex Pistols members in a chessboard composition on the left and black rectangle with a yellow sign EXISTENTIALIST in the middle and black and white photo of Sex Pistols members next to each other on the right.](book-cover-concept.jpg)

- This is a book cover I did for a typography class assignment. (*Note: The back on the left, the spine in the middle and the front of the book cover on the right.*)
- Creating this helped me to think more freely while designing because there were no limitations with the book topic or design. 
- It took me a while to come up with this, but I eventually managed to design it exactly the way I wanted to.



  ## *Thanks!*
