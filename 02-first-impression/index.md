## Featured Projects

A short description about the work.
A few of my projects I did recently.

### A pidgeon squad in front of a club

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

- A short description about the project — *the what*. A photomontage of a photo I randomly took while practicing photography. The original photo seemed too plain to me, so I decided to give it a little makeover.
- A short description about the significance of the project — *the whys*. This photomontage was somewhat crucial to me, because I learned a lot by this in terms of editing a photo. 
- A short description about the outcome of the project — *the result or takeaway*. This work made me realize that with a bit of imagination, you can turn a plain photo into a decent art piece.


### A concept poster for a music festival

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

- A short description about the project — *the what*. Concept posters for United Islands of Prague Festival.

- A short description about the significance of the project — *the whys*. The path of making these was a bit tricky in the beginning due to the abstract topic – music outside. I had to think outside the box.

- A short description about the outcome of the project — *the result or takeaway*. Fairly challenging project, but the newly learned skills and the result felt rewarding to me.


### Christmas post cards concept

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

- A short description about the project — *the what*. A concept for Christmas post cards as a school assignment.
- A short description about the significance of the project — *the whys*. I had fun while making these because we weren’t limited to anything in terms of the design. 
- A short description about the outcome of the project — *the result or takeaway*. I love the result of this because I got to create an unconventional, unique postcard without limiting myself to a plain Christmas postcard design. 


### Personal side project

<!-- Use a static poster image or animated GIF, but no video files. Again, keep the image width/height manageable, around 1280x x 720px (16:9 aspect ratio), or a max-width of 1280px. -->

- A short description about the project — *the what*. This is my own manga comics that has been my personal side project.  
- A short description about the significance of the project — *the whys*. This project was originally a graduation project in my senior year of high school. Soon after, I’ve realized how much I had enjoyed working on it and want to continue.
- A short description about the outcome of the project — *the result or takeaway*. My decision to continue with this project was sort of a breaking point of discovering something that has become one of my greatest passions as of today.
