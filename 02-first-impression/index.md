# About

## Adéla Koukalová



**Hi there! I'm Adela.** A graphic designer with attitude, style, and punk rock ethos.

I like to do things my way, unapologetically. Whenever I get to design something on my own, only then can I truly express myself without the constraints of awful ideas or rules. Artists are often misunderstood. We have a different perspective on things. On life.

And that‘s when it‘s my turn, an aspiring graphic designer, to prove them wrong and design something amazing.


# More about me

**I‘ve always been the quiet kid**,
ever since kindergarden. A very observant, though.
Since that time, I started noticing just how badly
people wanna fit in.
As much as I wanted to change and become another extroverted kid (peer pressure), I just couldn‘t. 
My introversion would always find its way back.  
A few years later - boom! Second year in college was
the milestone of it all. An insecure duckling has finally become a confident swan who doesn‘t give an F about other people‘s opinions. 
Not sure how exactly it happened, but I made it.
No more pleasing the others, just doing what makes me happy. Keeping my own style, no pressure to fit in. Whether it‘s just being an introvert or making art that‘s different from the rest. 
If you‘re quietly struggling like I once did, let me give you a simple advice: 
Don‘t be like everyone else. Be you.

## Featured Projects

A few of my projects I did recently.





### Night Club Photomontage

- A photomontage of a photo I randomly took while practicing photography. The original photo seemed too plain to me, so I decided to give it a little makeover.
- The whole working process of this was crucial to me because I learned a lot in terms of photo editing. 
- This little project made me realize that with a bit of imagination, you can turn a plain photo into a decent piece of art.




### Prague Music Festival Poster

- A concept poster for the United Islands of Prague Festival.

- The path of making these was a bit tricky in the beginning due to the rather abstract topic – music outside. I had to think outside the box.

- Fairly challenging project, but the newly learned skills and the final result felt rewarding.




### 2023 New Year’s Cards

- A concept for New Year's cards as a school assignment.
- I had fun while making these because we weren’t limited to anything in terms of the design. 
- I love the result of this because I got to create an unconventional, unique postcard without limiting myself to just make a plain New Year's card design. 




### Existentialist Book Cover


![Black and white photo of Sex Pistols members in a chessboard composition on the left and black rectangle with a yellow sign EXISTENTIALIST in the middle and black and white photo of Sex Pistols members next to each other on the right.](img/book-cover-concept.jpg)

- This is a book cover I did for a typography class assignment. 
- Creating this helped me to think more freely while designing because there were no limitations with the book topic or design. 
- It took me a while to come up with this, but I eventually managed to design it exactly the way I wanted to.
